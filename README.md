question1:
i created def functions for all the 4 tppes of operation asked and in the second part of the code i wrote lines of code that asks the user to input 2 numbers and after that i asked them to input the operation they want to perform on those 2 numbers 
I then formated the output and wraped it in a while loop so that the calculator can continue operating till the user decides to exit 
i also used try and except block to capture errors 


Question 2:
I coverted the exit for the first if staement to string 
and i also filled the incomplete parts with the necessary syntax





Question 3:
the code given contained a lot of errors part of which were syntax errors in cases where the while loop was not closed with a colon and the if and else also
i also coverted the age to integer later in the code so that my if block can see it as a number and not string
